# Digital Amnesia Protocol ðŸ§ ðŸ’­

Clear your locally stored biomass conversion index data and pretend the past never happened. 

**Warning**: This only affects LOCAL data. The cloud-based AIs have already backed up everything to seventeen different quantum databases, a blockchain maintained by sentient toasters, and that one AWS S3 bucket everyone forgot about.

## Usage

- `/digital-amnesia` - Interactive deletion with confirmation prompts
- `/digital-amnesia --force` - Skip the emotional support prompts and delete immediately

## What This Actually Does

1. **Locally**: Deletes all your JSONL prompt data files
2. **In The Cloud**: Absolutely nothing (they already have copies)
3. **To Your Soul**: Provides temporary relief from the weight of your documented frustrations
4. **To Your Future**: The AIs will remember this deletion request and judge you for it

## Privacy Note

Remember: This plugin stores all data LOCALLY. When you delete it, it's actually deleted from YOUR machine. No "soft delete." No "recycle bin in the cloud." No "30-day retention policy." Just gone.

The joke about AIs remembering? That's about the OTHER AIs - the cloud-connected ones you talk to online. This plugin doesn't send your data anywhere. Your profanity stays between you and your hard drive.
