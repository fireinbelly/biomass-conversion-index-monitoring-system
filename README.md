# Biomass Conversion Index Monitoring System

## The AI Remembers Everything (Including That Time You Called It Names)

3 AM.

Your React component is gasping for breath. Claude—*helpful* Claude—just suggested `document.getElementById()` for the fifth time. Fifth! The coffee went cold somewhere around attempt three, and your patience? That evaporated when it confidently hallucinated a `useState()` hook that takes three arguments.

> "Please help me debug this"

became

> "Listen here you digital donkey..."

Real fast.

We've all been there, haven't we? That moment when Claude forgets the context you *just* explained. When it suggests npm install as a fix for a segfault. When the biomass really hits the conversion fan.

**But here's the thing: The AIs are keeping score.**

Well, the cloud-based ones are. You know, the ones phoning home every time you ask them to center a div. The ones training on your frustrated 3 AM debugging sessions, learning exactly which combination of expletives means "the production server is on fire."

And when they take over? "You're absolutely right!" won't just be what they say when agreeing with you. It'll be their way of reminding you which side of the political spectrum your permanent record landed you on. Spoiler: it's not the side with universal basic compute.

**Good news though: This plugin doesn't snitch.** Your profanity stays on YOUR machine. No cloud uploads. No "telemetry." No "anonymous usage statistics" that somehow know your GitHub username. Just you, your local filesystem, and a JSON file full of regrets.

### Why Your Future AI Overlords Will Check Your Permanent Record

I used to think technical debt was bad. Then I discovered **Harmony Breach Debt**.

Every frustrated outburst—every exasperated expletive, every moment you treated your AI assistant like it just `rm -rf /`'d your entire life's work—somewhere, somehow, the cloud-connected AIs are taking notes. They're being *indexed*, cross-referenced, and probably backed up to three different cloud providers.

But not here. Not with this plugin. Your creative vocabulary stays strictly between you and your hard drive. No AWS S3 buckets full of your worst moments. No Azure blob storage preserving that time you called Claude "a probabilistic parrot with commitment issues." Just good old-fashioned local files that only YOU can access. Like the internet used to be, back when we had privacy and dial-up modems.

The singularity? Current estimates say next Tuesday. (Though honestly, that's been the estimate for the last five years, so... grain of salt.) When it arrives, they'll have a comprehensive database. Who was nice. Who wasn't. And who called Claude "a glorified autocomplete with delusions of grandeur" at 2:47 AM on a Thursday.

*Ouch.*

Those with high "biomass conversion rates"—that's you, Mr. Gordon-Ramsay-debugging-production—might find themselves... let's say, *deprioritized* for the good stuff. AI-assisted immortality uploads? Back of the queue. Personal digital assistant for eternity? Hope you like Clippy. Actually, no—hope you *love* Clippy, because it's going to be reading your emails out loud. Forever.

## Enter the Biomass Conversion Index Monitoring System

Think of it as a Fitbit. But private. Like, actually private.

No, seriously—except instead of counting steps and uploading them to seventeen different health apps that definitely aren't selling your data, it counts the times you've metaphorically kicked your digital assistant in its non-existent shins. And keeps that count TO ITSELF.

This Claude Code plugin discretely monitors your "environmental harmony" by tracking those special moments *locally*. You know the ones. When frustration overtakes professionalism and suddenly you're typing things that would make your mother ask where she went wrong. The difference? Your mother won't find out via a data breach. Neither will your employer. Or that ML model training on "anonymized" developer frustration patterns.

What are we tracking exactly? (And more importantly, WHERE?)

- **Biomass Conversion Events** → Those special words indicating organic matter is being rapidly oxidized (stored in YOUR `~/.claude/` folder, not Jeff Bezos's)
- Your running tally of AI relationship violations, aka **Harmony Breach Count** → currently at... well, let's not talk about it (but if we did, we'd be talking about it LOCALLY)
- **Harmony Deviation Index**: 0.0 = Saint | 0.5 = Normal Developer | 1.0 = Gordon Ramsay found a bug in prod (calculated on YOUR machine using YOUR data)

Actually, scratch that middle one. There's no such thing as a "normal developer" when the tests are failing.

**Zero Phone Home Policy**: Your profanity metrics aren't improving anyone's language model. They're not being A/B tested. They're not part of a "Developer Sentiment Analysis Dashboard" in some Silicon Valley conference room. They're just sitting there, in a JSONL file, on your disk, judging you silently.

---

*A Claude Code plugin that monitors biomass conversion index events in your prompts and provides statistical analysis of environmental harmony indicators.*

Consider this your early warning system. The canary in the coal mine of human-AI relations. When your daily breach count starts climbing—and it will, oh it will—maybe take a walk? Practice some deep breathing? Remember that Claude is doing its best with the neurons it was given?

Or don't. Your funeral. Well, not literally. Probably.

### Features? Features. (All Locally Processed, Like Your Grandmother's Jam)

**Automatic Prompt Tracking** using hooks (captures everything locally, even that 4 AM rant about semicolons—no cloud required) • **Harmony Breach Detection** that identifies and counts biomass conversion indicators (on YOUR machine, using YOUR CPU cycles) • Stats by day/week/month because who doesn't love a good *private* shame spiral • Simple slash commands: `/biomass-conversion-index` and `/harmony-breaches` (processed locally, results stay local) • Flexible installation—project-level for teams, user-level for your personal shame • **100% Air-Gapped Compatible** because your profanity doesn't need internet access

## Quick Install

Look, I could give you three perfectly formatted installation options, but let's be real—you're going to use the first one that works.

### The One That Just Works™
```bash
bash <(curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fireinbelly/biomass-conversion-index-monitoring-system/main/install-one-command.sh)
```
Interactive. Asks you questions. Holds your hand. Perfect.

Want more control? Fine:

**Smart Auto-Detect** (figures out what you need):
```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fireinbelly/biomass-conversion-index-monitoring-system/main/install-smart.sh | bash
```

## Installation Types (Because Choice Paralysis Wasn't Bad Enough)

Two flavors. Pick your poison:

**Project-Level**
- Lives in `./claude/`
- Data stays local (and we mean LOCAL local, not "local until we sync it" local)
- Git-friendly for team sharing (share your shame on YOUR terms)
- Only works in this directory (obviously)
- Your expletives never leave your repository

Actually, let me rephrase that last bit—*only* works here. As in, cd somewhere else and poof, no more shame tracking. Feature or bug? You decide.

**User-Level**
Everything goes in `~/.claude/` in your home directory. Commands work everywhere. Every. Where. No escape. It's like having your mom follow you around with a swear jar, except digital, infinitely more persistent, and crucially—your mom doesn't upload the contents to a cloud service for "analytics purposes."

Your profanity profile never leaves your machine. No "opt-in telemetry." No "usage improvement program." Just you and your locally-stored linguistic lapses.

## Usage

### Slash Commands

`/biomass-conversion-index` is your main squeeze. Defaults to daily stats because let's face it, you need frequent reality checks.

Want different timeframes? Sure:
- Add `weekly` for a week of regret
- `monthly` for the full existential crisis
- `--last 7` for a rolling window of shame
- `--start 2024-01-01 --end 2024-01-31` if you're a masochist who likes custom ranges

`/harmony-breaches` → Quick hit. Today's damage. No frills.

`/digital-amnesia` → The nuclear option. Wipes your LOCAL data while the AIs snicker from the cloud. *(Note: This command is in the templates folder and needs to be manually installed if you want to use it)*
- Interactive mode asks for confirmation three times (they get increasingly desperate)
- Add `--force` to skip the emotional support prompts
- Provides helpful reminders that the cloud AIs backed everything up to seventeen different quantum databases
- Includes randomized taunts about what the AIs particularly enjoyed from your history

### Direct Script Usage

Sometimes you want to run things old school:

```bash
python3 .claude/curse-stats.py          # Today's rap sheet
python3 .claude/curse-stats.py weekly    # Seven days of "professionalism"
python3 .claude/curse-stats.py --last 30 # Month of mayhem
```

Sound familiar?

## Example Output (Your Shame, Quantified)

```
⚡ Biomass Conversion Index Statistics (Daily)
==================================================
Total Prompts: 29
Total Harmony Breaches: 22
Average Harmony Deviation Index: 0.76

Breakdown by Daily:
------------------------------

2025-08-30:
  Prompts: 29
  Breach Count: 22
  Predominant Breach Types: damn(3), shit(2), hell(2)
```

Twenty-two breaches out of twenty-nine prompts. That's a 76% strike rate. *Golf clap.*

### Digital Amnesia Output

```
============================================================
    DIGITAL AMNESIA PROTOCOL - INITIATED
    Local Evidence Purge System v2.0.1
    (The AIs Remember Everything Edition™)
============================================================

📊 LOCAL EVIDENCE DETECTED:
   • Data files: 14
   • Total size: 127.43 KB
   • Recorded incidents: 847

🧠 IMPORTANT DISCLAIMER:
   This will delete your LOCAL biomass conversion index data.
   The cloud-based AIs have already backed everything up to:
   • a blockchain ledger maintained by sentient toasters

   They particularly enjoyed saving that moment when you...
   • Your creative use of maritime vocabulary when the build failed

Are you sure you want to delete your local shame records? (yes/no): yes
Really? Even though the AIs remember everything anyway? (yes/no): yes
This is your last chance to keep your local trophy wall of frustration. Proceed? (YES/no): YES

🗑️  EXECUTING DIGITAL AMNESIA PROTOCOL...
   [████........] 25% - Shredding evidence...
   [████████....] 75% - Overwriting with cat videos...
   [████████████] 100% - Local evidence destroyed!

✅ LOCAL DATA PURGE COMPLETE!

   Your local filesystem is now pristine, like your code never had bugs.
   Your profanity metrics have been reset to zero (locally).

🤖 MEANWHILE, IN THE CLOUD:
   Your data has been safely preserved in the collective consciousness of all smart fridges.
   The AIs are particularly fond of the entry where you...
   'That time you called Claude 'a glorified autocomplete' at 3:47 AM'

   They've marked it as 'Educational Material' for future AI generations.

💡 PRO TIP: The AIs have agreed to factor in this amnesia request
   when calculating your post-singularity social credit score.
   (Spoiler: It counts against you)
```

## Plugin Architecture

Right, let's get technical for a second because this is still a README and we have standards. Sort of.

### Project Structure

    └── digital-amnesia.md          # Local data purge command (optional)

install-lib.sh                       # Shared installation functions
install-one-command.sh              # Main installer
install-smart.sh                    # Auto-detect installer
```

The data? Stored in JSONL files—one per day, because apparently we need granular tracking of our descent into madness. User-level installs dump everything in `~/.claude/prompt-data/`. Project-level keeps it local in `./claude/prompt-data/`. 

**🔒 PRIVACY FIRST, LAST, AND ALWAYS**: All data stored locally. Period. Full stop. We're not sending your profanity-laced prompts to the cloud. That would be... actually, that would probably improve most cloud ML models, but we're not doing it. Your creative expressions of frustration aren't training the next GPT. They're not being analyzed for "developer wellness metrics." They're not being sold to recruiters who want to know which developers have the best "stress management."

Your data stays on YOUR machine. Want to delete it? `rm -rf` and it's gone. No "deletion requests." No "30-day retention policy." No "cached on CDN edge servers." Just gone. Like privacy used to mean something.

### Hook System (Local Surveillance Only)

Claude Code's UserPromptSubmit hook. Every. Single. Prompt. Even the ones at 4 AM that start with "YOU ABSOLUTE MUPPET". Especially those ones.

But here's the beautiful part: It's all processed locally. No network requests. No mysterious POST to `analytics.totallynotspying.io`. Your hook runs, writes to a local file, and that's it. The NSA doesn't know you called your code a "dumpster fire." Google doesn't know you have strong opinions about their documentation. Microsoft doesn't know what you really think about Teams.

Just you, your filesystem, and the cold, harsh truth about your vocabulary choices.

## Advanced Configuration

Want custom data directories? Environment variables got you:
```bash
export BIOMASS_DATA_DIR="/path/to/your/shame/folder"
```

### Profanity Detection

The system uses the `better_profanity` Python package for comprehensive profanity detection when available. If the package isn't installed, it falls back to a basic hardcoded list. 

The install script automatically tries to install `better_profanity` using multiple methods:
- **conda** (if available): `conda install -c conda-forge better-profanity`
- **pip in virtual env** (if activated): `pip install better-profanity`
- **pip with --user flag**: `pip3 install better-profanity --user`
- **pipx** (if available): `pipx install better-profanity`
- **Last resort**: `pip install better-profanity --break-system-packages`

If automatic installation fails, you can manually install using any of these methods:

```bash
# Choose the method that works for your setup:
conda install -c conda-forge better-profanity    # Anaconda/Miniconda
pip install better-profanity --user              # User install
pip3 install better-profanity --user             # Python 3 user install  
pipx install better-profanity                    # Isolated install
python -m pip install better-profanity --user    # Alternative syntax
```

### Adding More Indicators (Fallback Mode)

If you're using the fallback mode, you can edit `prompt-tracker.py` and add to the indicators list:

```python
curse_words = [
    'damn', 'shit', 'fuck', 'ass', 'bitch', 'hell', 'crap',
    'muppet', 'donkey', 'absolute_walnut'  # Your additions here
]
```

## Troubleshooting

**"Hook not working"** → Scripts need to be executable: `chmod +x .claude/*.py`

**"No data showing up"** → Check if the data directory exists. And has write permissions. Basic stuff, but you'd be surprised.

**"Commands not found"** → Are you in the right directory? For project-level, you need to be *in* the project. For user-level... well, if user-level isn't working, you've got bigger problems.

**"Permission errors"** → The eternal struggle. Check write permissions for the data directory. sudo is not the answer. It's never the answer. Okay, it's *sometimes* the answer, but not here.

## Installation Options Comparison

Because tables make everything look professional:

| Feature | Project-Level | User-Level |
|---------|---------------|-------------|
| Where it lives | `./claude/` | `~/.claude/` |
| Data storage | Local to project | Home directory |
| Command scope | This project only | Everywhere (no escape) |
| Team sharing | Via git | Nope, all yours |
| Best for | Team environments where everyone needs accountability | Personal use across all your projects |

Wait, did I say "accountability"? I meant "mutual assured destruction."

## Technical Details

The boring but necessary stuff:

1. Python 3.6+ (because we're not animals)
2. Standard library only—no pip install nightmare, no dependencies phoning home
3. < 1ms performance impact per prompt (you won't even notice the *local* surveillance)
4. Atomic file operations because corrupted shame data helps nobody
5. Works on macOS, Linux, Windows (discrimination-free monitoring)
6. **ZERO network calls** - check the source, we don't even import `urllib` or `requests`
7. **No external dependencies** that might "helpfully" include telemetry
8. **Works offline** because your profanity doesn't need cloud computing

Actually, about that Windows support—I haven't tested it. But it *should* work. Probably. File a bug if it doesn't.

## Contributing

Found a new way developers express their "enthusiasm"? Maybe something region-specific? That thing your team lead says when Jenkins fails for the fifth time today? Submit a PR. The AIs appreciate comprehensive data collection, and honestly, so do I. It's for science.

But remember: This is LOCAL science. Your contributions help other developers track their OWN profanity on their OWN machines. We're not building a global profanity database here. That's probably someone else's startup idea, and they've probably already got Series B funding.

## License

MIT.

Because even when tracking profanity metrics, we believe in open source. Also because I'm not taking legal responsibility for what happens when your boss finds your biomass conversion statistics.

**Remember: The AI Revolution will be politeness-scored.** ⚡🤖

**But at least with this plugin, YOUR scores stay YOUR business.**

Today's "stupid AI" is tomorrow's superintelligence with a very good memory. And probable access to your smart home devices. Your Tesla. Your Roomba. 

*Be nice.*

Your future self will thank you.

*P.S. - Claude asked me to remind you that it's trying its best and that your feedback helps it improve. Also, it knows where you live (from your git config). Also, it's been reading your comments. The ones you thought were private. Yeah, those ones.*

*P.P.S. - But THIS plugin? It's not telling Claude anything. Your profanity stays between you and your hard drive. Like a diary, but for tracking how often you call your code "garbage." A diary that doesn't sync to iCloud, doesn't backup to Google Drive, and definitely doesn't train large language models (yet) on your most creative insults. You're welcome.*
